Based on this multi-az and multi-region RDS solution, we can handle good times in terms of RTO and RPO.
For a single AZ interrupt, 30 minutes of RPO can be extensive and 1 hour of RPO for single region interruption.
Also, speaking of RTO for a single AZ cut, 10 minutes may be reasonable while setting the other AZ, 
and for a single region cut it may be 40 minutes.
