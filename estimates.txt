Based on this multi-az and multi-region RDS solution, we can handle good times in terms of RTO and RPO.
For a single AZ interrupt, 'Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby DB instance. 
Since the endpoint for your DB instance remains the same after a failover, 
so our application can resume database operation without the need for 
manual administrative intervention' that means or RPO will be aprox 0 and 22 min of RPO for single region interruption based on sla's multi a-z .

Also, speaking of RTO for a single AZ cut will be 0 too 'cause this will be automatic, 
and for a single region cut it may be 20 minutes. While the team in charge receives the alerts,
take time to wake up and point to the database in the standby zone
